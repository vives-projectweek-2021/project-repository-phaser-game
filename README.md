# Phaser Game

Our idea is to make an infinite runner game. Where the objective is to get the character as far as possible while avoiding obstacles (and collect coins). 

We chose an endless runner because you can start very simple and build up from there.

Some endless runners are very well-known for their addictiveness, like Subway Surfers, Temple Run, Jetpack Joyride, Flappy Bird and the Google Dinosaur Game (when you donâ€™t have an internet connection in Chrome).

- Double jump
- Left right moveable (finetune)

- Jumpboost
- Speed
- Triple jump
- Extra life
- Coins (extra points)

#### Debuffs

## Hosting

Phaser can be hosted from netlify, Because the webpage is static.

But we will host the project from a Windows server. This is because This is difficult to work together on the same document at the same time. And with this solution, we can work on a smb share. So every change is directly connected to each other. This way everyone can see all the changes in real time.

This also makes it possible to host a sql server and to create a player database for example (This is an extra if we have some spare time).
